# Machine-Learning

This is the code from my Machine Learning classes I and II in 2020 and 2021 where I learned how to use deep-learning libraries such as Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow with Keras for various problems given in class. Additionally, I used the knowledge I gained in this class to compete in the National Machine Learning Open held by TJHSST in August of 2020 to place in the top 15 of all participants. My code for that competition is in the NMLO folder.
